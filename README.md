# High-Dimensional Robust Portfolio Optimization

This repository contains the code and resources for the Master's thesis "High-Dimensional Robust Portfolio Optimization Under Sparse Contamination: A Factor-Analytic Approach" by Stefano Blando, completed at Universit√† degli studi di Roma "Tor Vergata".

## Overview

This research introduces novel robust estimation methods for portfolio optimization in high-dimensional settings with contaminated financial data. Key contributions include:

- The Parallel Factor Space Estimator (PFSE) method
- The Sequential Screening Robust Estimator (SSRE) method
- Multi-scenario stress testing framework for portfolio resilience
- Interactive dashboard for method exploration and visualization
